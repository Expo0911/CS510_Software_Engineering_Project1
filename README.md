Mini Project 1
==============

Write a "single-page app" and develop its configuration management.

**Goal**: Gain experience with the following technologies:

[Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/), [knockoutjs](http://knockoutjs.com/), [less](http://lesscss.org/), javascript, [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), [bower](http://bower.io/), [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [d3](http://d3js.org/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/)

**Learning outcome**: Realize that most software engineering projects will require learning many technologies together.  Gain experience in using some technologies, such as grunt and bower, to help bridge the multiple technologies in a single process.

### Getting Started with your Template

Get the project template using git:

1) `git clone https://github.ncsu.edu/CSC510-Fall2014/MiniProject1-Template.git`

2) Run `npm install` to get project dependencies installed (grunt, bower). Npm is installed when you install node.js.

3) Run `bower install` to get web dependencies installed (bootstrap,jquery).
A local copy of Bower will be installed in `node_modules/bower/bin/bower`.  However, you may want to have a global version installed using `npm install -g bower`.

4) Test out grunt by running `grunt less` to run the less task that will compile the bootstrap less file into a css file usable by your site.  Open `www\index.html` in your browser.  A local copy of grunt will be installed in `node_modules/grunt-cli/bin/grunt`. However, you may want to have a global version installed using `npm install -g grunt` and `npm install -g grunt-cli`.


### Use [bower](http://bower.io/) to manage components.

Use bower to install additionally install:

* knockoutjs
* d3

Dependencies should be saved in `bower.json` using the `-S` option.

### App content and javascript

The main goal of the app content and javascript is just to put into use all the dependencies you are managing with bower and grunt.  Any javascript you create can be placed in a `site.js` or embedded in the index.html.  All the dependencies (knockout, d3, etc) will be generated by grunt into the `libs.js` file.

* Use [bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/) to create responsive layout (resilient to mobile screen sizes). A good resource for understanding the grid layout system: [Bootstrap Grid Explained](http://www.helloerik.com/the-subtle-magic-behind-why-the-bootstrap-3-grid-works).  Bootstrap simply provides a set of predefined css classes for helping layout the website.  `www/index.html` Already contains a basic layout using bootstrap.  Any additional css classes should be defined in your `local.less` file and compiled in the grunt task as specified below.
* Use [knockoutjs](http://knockoutjs.com/) to process user input and any dynamic content. The documentation for knockoutjs is pretty good.  A good example to start with is the [foreach binding](http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/foreach-binding.html) for getting a list of content.  I use this do generate the list of papers on my [website](http://chrisparnin.me).
* Use [d3](http://d3js.org/) add a visualization component to the site. See [http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock) for inspiration (you can directly use any example as well).

### Use [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) to manage build tasks.

Create a grunt task to:

* Extend current `less` task to compile an additional `local.less` file, containing your custom presentation elements into a css file.
* Create a new grunt task, called `package` to concat all javascript libraries into a single `"www\js\libs.js"` file.  Additionally, minify the content using uglify or an equivalent minifying tool. 
* Create a new grunt task, called `validate` that runs `jshint` on all javascript files in app.
* Create a `build_all` task that runs all the steps needed to build the web app.

### Grading

You will be graded on the configuration management of your app as well as your use of technology in building the app.

* 10% bower setup
* 40% grunt tasks
* 20% app layout and content
* 15% incorporate user input/dynamic content with knockoutjs
* 15% incorporate visualization with d3
